# 6 DATA AND SOFTWARE ACCESS AND AVAILABILITY
Insofar as is practical, the HERMES SOC will be developed and operated consistent with SMDâ€™s Strategy for Data Management and Computing for Groundbreaking Science 2019-2024 which applies to both data as well as software. There will be no proprietary periods associated with any of the HERMES data products, and users will have timely access to all relevant data products. Data will generally be publicly released as soon as possible and according to the release schedule specified in Table 4-3. To help ensure that data and software is findable and accessible, access will be centralized at the SOC/SDC. The SOC/SDC will also provide access to data via web-based interfaces consistent with community standards and will also provide an Application Programming Interface (API) for automated access to the data using accepted community standards.
