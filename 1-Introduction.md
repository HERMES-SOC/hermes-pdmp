# 1 Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose

This document describes the Project Data Management Plan (PDMP) for the Heliophysics Environmental and Radiation Measurement Experiment Suite (HERMES). HERMES is a suite of four instruments that will be hosted on the Gateway space station. Gateway will be launched into an orbit near the Moon to support crewed missions to the Moon. This PDMP is the interface document between NASA, the mission systems, and the instrument teams that describes the science and ancillary data associated with the mission and how the data will be produced and managed. This document describes how the mission will meet the HERMES Level 1 requirements that address the preparation and distribution of processed science data for the public.

The plan defines how the data will be generated, processed, distributed, and archived. The plan addresses all the requirements of NPR 2200.1D, Management of NASA Scientific and Technical Information, NPR 2200.2D, Requirements for Documentation, Approval, and Dissemination of NASA Scientific and Technical Information, and NPR 1441.1E Records Retention Schedule (as applied to scientific data).

Described in this plan are:
* An overview of the HERMES science objectives, mission concept, and instrumentation,
* Roles and responsibilities of all institutions expected to participate in the HERMES data production, dissemination, and archival activities,
* Identification and description of the various types of HERMES data including data volume estimates.
* Descriptions of data flow between key HERMES project entities.
* Description of planned data distribution and access methods.
* Plans for mission data archival.

## Scope

This plan applies to the HERMES Project and all NASA HERMES support civil servants and support service contractors.
1.3 Responsibility

Developing, maintaining, and managing this PDMP is a HERMES Project responsibility. The Science Operations Center (SOC) at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has been designated for the development and maintenance of this plan under the direction of the HERMES Project Scientist (PS).
